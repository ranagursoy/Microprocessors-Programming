The purpose of the experiment is to make a calculator. While “*” button works as the function button
(here, we will use for summing two numbers), “#” button works as execute button. An example for the
output is given below:
LCD SCREEN
12*56#
68
Adding 12 and 56 numbers
The calculator should only perform 2-digit operations. For example, when "356" is written on the screen,
it should return a warning message like "Please enter a 2-digit number" for 1 second. The steps to follow
are:
• Turn button reading codes into a function (return as integer/character, it depends on you).
• Find a way to convert the incoming button character/digits into multi-digit number. There are
several methods after this phase. You can receive all the six characters, then execute, or you can
evaluate each character till “*” or “#” is pressed (this method is more proper for general solution
if the numbers were not limited as two digits).
• You should check if ‘*’ or ‘#’ is not pressed properly. If not, print a warning message for 1000ms,
then restart the algorithm.
• If your check is successful, then print the solution for 3000ms, then clear the screen and restart
the algorithm.
