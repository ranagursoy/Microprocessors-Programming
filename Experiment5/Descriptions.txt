The purpose of this experiment is to implement an ADC process that occurs for each 2 seconds using a
Timer. ADC readings coming from 2 potentiometers should be made every 2 seconds by using a Timer
and the first reading should be on the first line and the second reading should be on the second line of
the LCD screen.
