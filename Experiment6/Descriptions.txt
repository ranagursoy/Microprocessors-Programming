The purpose of this experiment is to realize the speed and direction control of a DC motor. The steps to
follow are:
• When the "Increase" button is pressed, the % Duty Cycle of the generated PWM signal will
increase. Therefore, the rotational speed of the DC motor should also increase.
• When the "Decrease" button is pressed, the % Duty Cycle of the generated PWM signal will
decrease. Therefore, the rotational speed of the DC motor should also decrease.
• The % Duty Cycle must be a maximum of 100% and a minimum of 0% (Limitation can be made
with the if (...) command).
• If the "Change Direction" button is pressed an odd number of times, the DC motor should turn
CW, and if the button is pressed an even number of times, the DC motor should rotate CCW
(Create a counter and use modulo operation).
