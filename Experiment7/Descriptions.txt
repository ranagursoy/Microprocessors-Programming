The purpose of this experiment is serial communication of two different microcontrollers. The
experiment can be summarized as follows:
• Suppose that you need to control a system with PID controller. However, it is not always easy
to change the PID gain parameters, which are embedded to the code statically. For this reason,
it would be better to alter the parameters with a serial communication in order to see the effect
rapidly in real-time.
• You should send a string array with combination of your student ID via serial communication
(your student ID is represented as “a b c d _ e f g”).
• The message you will send from serial writer to serial reader is defined as “afPdgIdfD”. For
example; if your student ID is 12345678, then you should send 17P48I47D.
• These characters should be sent with the second microcontroller that represents the serial input
line for simulation purpose. In your serial reader code, these characters should be parsed to P,
I and D parameters as 17, 48 and 47, respectively. These Kp, Ki and Kd parameters should be
shown on the serial communication screen (virtual terminal given in circuit) and LCD screen.
